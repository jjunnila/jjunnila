### About me

Moi! I am Joakim Junnila, a 2nd year Information Processing Science student from Oulu. I currently have experience in: 
- Java, C, and a bit of Python
- SQLite
- JUnit testing
- UML notation
- Agile / Scrum

I also have learned about Software Engineering concepts such as 
- Java design patterns
- Performance analysis
- Requirements engineering
- Some algorithms and data structures...

Speaking of which, if you would be interested in seeing some of my implementations of algorithms and data structures, feel free to contact me! I'd be excited to show them to you. They are currently in a private repository because they are from a university course work, but I can add you as a collaborator to that repo if you'd like. In that course work I implemented algorithms such as a Binary Search, QuickSort, HeapSort, breadth-first and depth-first searches as well as a Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. Implemented data structures include a basic queue, a stack, a binary search tree, a graph, and a hash table with a custom hashing function. In the implementations I utilized design patterns such as Visitors and Factories. In other course work I have also implemented an Adapter pattern. 

Currently scheming some more public projects to do. I've been thinking about a couple ideas, maybe soon I will get them done!
